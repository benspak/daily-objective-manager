# Daily Objectives Chrome Extension

## Prompt Used

Help me create a chrome browser plugin that allows me to enter my top 5 daily objectives into an input form.

Everyday, I am prompted for a new set of objectives, and the previous set of objectives are archived.

I should be able view a list of past days and the objectives completed in the past.

List each objective as a bullet point under the date.

Store everything in in-browser storage.

Sample objectives:

- Code browser plugin
- Walk 3 times
- Log Meals
- Dio's Litter Box
- Apply to 20 jobs

Edge cases to keep in mind:

Do not allow duplicate daily entries. Only allow one daily submission of objectives.

Allow users to delete past days, with their respective objectives.

Display past objectives in a tab that can be opened by clicking a button via the popup.
